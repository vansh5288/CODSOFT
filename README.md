# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## Internship
CODSOFT – Data Science Internship

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on historical passenger data.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Embarkation port
- Survival status

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **80–82%**, indicating good predictive performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Status
✅ Task 1 completed successfully
